## Introduction
The study of matching investigates stable matchings among people, institutes and goods. Starting with Gale and Shapley (1962)â€™s deferred acceptance (DA) algorithm, this study has been successfully utilised in the real world, especially in school choice since the early 2000s.
This repo covers (so far):
- DA algorithm for school choice (student optimal)
- DA algorithm with random tie-break lotteries
- Examples of above algorithms usage

## Usage
### [Simple DA algorithm](/examples/simple_school_choice.py)
After input student and school's preference and schools' quota,
```python
from deferred_acceptance.deferred_acceptance import deferred_acceptance
from deferred_acceptance.utils import create_dataframes


students_df, schools_df = create_dataframes(
        students_list=students_list,
        students_preferences=students_preferences,
        schools_list=schools_list,
        schools_preferences=schools_preferences,
    )
matches = deferred_acceptance(
        students_df=students_df, schools_df=schools_df, schools_quota=schools_quota
    )
```

### [DA algorithm with random tie-break lotteries](/examples/tie_break_school_choice.py)
```python
from deferred_acceptance.deferred_acceptance import deferred_acceptance
from deferred_acceptance.utils import create_dataframes, tie_break


students_df, schools_df = create_dataframes(
        students_list=students_list,
        students_preferences=students_preferences,
        schools_list=schools_list,
        schools_preferences=schools_preferences,
    )

strict_school_df = tie_break(schools_df)
matches = deferred_acceptance(
    students_df=students_df,
    schools_df=strict_school_df,
    schools_quota=schools_quota,
)
```
